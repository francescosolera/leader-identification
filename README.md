# leader-identification
### a learning approach to (page)rank members of social groups to detect their leaders

Leader identification is a crucial task in social analysis, crowd management and emergency planning. In this paper, we investigate a computational model for the individuation of leaders in crowded scenes. We deal with the lack of a formal definition of leadership by learning, in a supervised fashion, a metric space based exclusively on people spatiotemporal information. Based on Tardeâ€™s work on crowd psychology, individuals are modeled as nodes of a directed graph and leaders inherits their relevance thanks to other members references. We note this is analogous to the way websites are ranked by the PageRank algorithm. A compact diagram depicting the input and the training process is shown in the figure below.<br /><br />

### how to run the code
The code can be run as it from the `main.m` file. Features will be computed and the training will start.
The main code does not visualize results. In order to do that, you will need to download additional video/images data - please contact me if you need them.
